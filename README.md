# todolist
I have created a simple to-do list using Django and HTML, which tracks completed and unfinished tasks. This project is available on my GitHub.

This project was created solely for my personal needs and unfortunately, I'm not very skilled in frontend development. I had very little time to work on it, but I found it interesting to build something that I needed. I plan to improve and develop it over time. I would be grateful if you could also contribute to it and make it better if you are interested.
